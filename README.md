# PSoC&trade; 4 MCU:  Flash and Chip Protection

*Disclaimer: This is a community code example (CCE) released for the benefit of the community users. These projects have only been tested for the listed BSPs, tools versions, and toolchains documented in this readme. They are intended to demonstrate how a solution / concept / use-case can be achieved on a particular device. For official code examples, please click [here](https://github.com/Infineon/Code-Examples-for-ModusToolbox-Software).*

This project demonstrates how to add flash and chip protection settings into the hex file. Flash memory is organized in rows. You can assign one of two protection levels to each row(Unprotected, Full Protection). Flash protection levels can only be changed by performing a complete flash erase. The three levels of chip protection are:

- **Open : This is the factory default mode. Flash can be programmed and user-mode access for CPU and debugger features is supported. Privileged mode access restrictions are enforced.**

- **Protected : You may change the mode from OPEN to PROTECTED. Doing so disables all debug access to user code or memory. Only access to user registers remains available; this prevents debug access to reprogram flash. You can reset the mode to OPEN but only after you completely erase the flash.**

- **Kill : You may change the mode from OPEN to KILL. Doing so removes all debug access to user code or memory and the flash cannot be erased. Only access to user registers remains available; this prevents debug access to reprogram flash. Note that the part cannot be taken out of KILL mode; devices in KILL mode may not be returned for failure analysis.**

## Hardware Setup

This example requires no additional hardwares.

## Software Setup
This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-149* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc4-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Ensure that the linker script contains the .cyflashprotect and .cychipprotect sections like so - 
```
.cyflashprotect 0x90400000 : { KEEP(*(.cyflashprotect)) } :NONE
.cychipprotect  0x90600000 : { KEEP(*(.cychipprotect)) } :NONE
```

2. Add the following code in the source file - 
```
#if defined(__GNUC__) || defined(__ARMCC_VERSION)
#ifndef CY_FLASH_PROT_SECTION
#define CY_FLASH_PROT_SECTION __attribute__ ((__section__(".cyflashprotect"), used))
#endif
CY_FLASH_PROT_SECTION
#elif defined(__ICCARM__)
#pragma  location=".cyflashprotect"
#else
#error "Unsupported toolchain"
#endif
const uint8_t cy_meta_flashprotect[] = {
    0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu,
    0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu,
    0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu,
    0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu,
    0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu,
    0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu,
    0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu,
    0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu, 0xFFu
};
```

This defines the flash protection settings for the device. Each bit indicates the flash protection setting for each individual row. Each bit value can be either 0 (Unprotected) or 1 (Protected).

3. Modify the flash protection structure as required.

4. Add the following source code for chip protection - 
```
#if defined(__GNUC__) || defined(__ARMCC_VERSION)
#ifndef CY_CHIP_PROT_SECTION
#define CY_CHIP_PROT_SECTION __attribute__ ((__section__(".cychipprotect"), used))
#endif
CY_CHIP_PROT_SECTION
#elif defined(__ICCARM__)
#pragma  location=".cychipprotect"
#else
#error "Unsupported toolchain"
#endif
const uint8_t cy_meta_chipprotect[] = {
    0x02u
};
```

Chip protection setting can be - 
* Open - 0x01
* Protected - 0x02
* Kill - 0x03

5. Add this POSTBUILD command in makefile –
```
POSTBUILD+="$(CY_TOOLS_DIR)/cymcuelftool-1.0/bin/cymcuelftool.exe" --sign $(CY_CONFIG_DIR)/$(APPNAME).elf --output $(CY_CONFIG_DIR)/$(APPNAME)_prot.elf --hex $(CY_CONFIG_DIR)/$(APPNAME)_prot.hex
```

6. Build the project and ensure that the hex file contains the flash and chip protection settings.
